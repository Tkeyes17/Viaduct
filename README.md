# Viaduct: Bridging San Antonioâ€™s Public Transportation to the Future
## Synopsis

Team Viaduct strives to collaborate with San Antonio residents and public transportation stake holders to improve San Antonio's public transportation network for all.  Utilizing data science to identify the root causes of low public transportation usage and suggesting new ideas to boost San Antonio's public transportation efficiency.   

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

San Antonio is the 7th largest city in the US, but rated 56th Nationally for public transportation trips per capita.  There is a plethora of data on traffic patterns, public transportation usuage, and public opinion on transportation.  Can a deep dive into available data reveal alternate solutions to the San Antonio public transportation system.  


## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
